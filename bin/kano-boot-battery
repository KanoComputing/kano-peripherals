# Detect if battery is present and with a low charge. Power off the kit if that's the case.
# This script is run very early on startup, when the filesystems are still mounted read only.
# See the file systemd/system/kano-bootup-battery.service for details.
#
# There are 2 ways to test this module manually:
#
#  1) Interactively, with "sudo kano-boot-battery --dry-run"
#  2) Faking low battery signal "sudo kano-boot-battery --enable-test && sudo reboot"
#
#  See the README for details: https://github.com/KanoComputing/kano-peripherals#kano-peripherals
